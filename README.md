Solutions to every exercise in The Go Programming Language.

Many of the exercises are based on an example from the book or an earlier exercise, and I've copied files as needed so there's a separate package for each exercise. If I'd been thinking I would have committed as I went so that it's easier to use git to see what I started from. As it is you'll need to determine the predecessor example or exercise and use `diff` for exercises after 5.6.
